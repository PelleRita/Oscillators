# Guide

In the folder called All_codes, you can find my LTspice simulations and Matlab codes connected to the created ring oscillator model.

Folder Partial_synchronization contains the analysing Matlab codes for the partial synchronization testing, also the extracted waveforms are attached as well. Run the code ‘corrtest.m’.

PCB_plan folder contains our PCB plans extracted from the CircuitMaker program.
